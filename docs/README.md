# CSSgridChallenge
CSS Grid is an application I created in order to further my understanding of CSS Grid and improve my front end development skills. One of the benefits I found from CSS Grid is that it allows for complete control over layout placement which is extremely useful when creating websites. I personally prefer CSS grid over Bootstrap, I feel like I have more control over placing objects. I also like how easily I can make websites responsive.
